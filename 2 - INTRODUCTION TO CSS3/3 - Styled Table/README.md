# Styled Table: mini-project overview

The objectives for this mini-project have been:

1) Create a style sheet and link it to the HTML files (without changing the HTML);
2) Style the sheet using the properties covered in lecture. There is a particular emphasis on pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. There is an opportunity to use some properties not covered in class. For instance, we want to style on the first element of each row to be left-aligned. The rest should be centered.
